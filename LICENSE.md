This mod is provided 'as is' with no warranties, implied or otherwise. The owner
of this mod takes no responsibility for any damages incurred from the use of

5. Derivation rights
--------------------

The user must license derived code under this license. The user may license addons under a different license, as long as no code from the parent mod is included. However, using an API without other code doesn't require compliance with this license. For example, if an addon extended the mod using an API and if that API is packaged with the mod then that API is code from the parent mod. However, since it is an API it may be extended and the addon may be under a different license
