Mod Public License, v2. WIP.
======================================
This license is intended to fix some of the problems and loopholes in the original [MMPL](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/blob/6.1.x/buildcraft_resources/LICENSE.txt), and in general make a modder-friendly, easily usable permissive license for mods of all types.
The goal is to achieve a compromise between protecting modders from theft and benefitting the community by allowing them to work with the code and create and distribute their own derivatives. Unfortunately the first intent is incompatible with the idea of Open Source, but we want to make it reasonably close to Open Source.

Please keep in mind that this is currently very work-in-progress. Ideas, tweaks, working adjustments, and partial rewrites are happening as members of the modding community contribute ideas or express concerns.  
Once we've got a version that we're comfortable with, @jakimfett is going to have his lawyer read it and suggest changes for purposes of clarity and legality.

Thanks for your patience while we work through this process.
