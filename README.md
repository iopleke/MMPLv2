Mod Public License, v2. WIP.
======================================
This license is intended to fix some of the problems and loopholes in the original [MMPL](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/blob/6.1.x/buildcraft_resources/LICENSE.txt), and in general make a modder-friendly, easily usable Open Source license for mods of all types.

Please keep in mind that this is currently very work-in-progress. Ideas, tweaks, working adjustments, and partial rewrites are happening as members of the modding community contribute ideas or express concerns.  
Once we've got a version that we're comfortable with, @jakimfett is going to have his lawyer read it and suggest changes for purposes of clarity and legality.

Thanks for your patience while we work through this process.

The license text is available for use and distribution under the terms of the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).
